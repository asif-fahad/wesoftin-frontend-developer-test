*Title:* Frontend Developer Technical Test

*Objective:* Create a simple web application using React and Tailwind CSS that displays a list of user profiles fetched from a mock API endpoint. The candidate should demonstrate their proficiency in React, component development, and UI design using Tailwind CSS.

*Instructions:*



1. Create a React application using Create React App or a similar tool.

2. Design and implement a user profile list page with the following features:
   - Fetch user profiles from a mock API endpoint (you can use a static JSON file or a placeholder API).
   - Use Redux to manage the state for the user profiles.
   - Display each user's name, email, and a profile picture.
   - Implement a responsive design using Tailwind CSS for the user profile cards.
3. Utilize the Context API for any shared state that doesn't need to be managed by Redux.

4. Create a separate detail view for each user profile. When a user clicks on a profile card, it should navigate to a detail view displaying additional information about the user. You can choose what additional information to display.

5. Implement routing in your React application to navigate between the list view and detail view.

6. Make sure your application is well-structured, maintainable, and follows best practices for React development.

7. Deploy your application to a hosting service of your choice (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) and provide a live URL for us to review.

8. Share your GitHub repository URL with us by sending an email to wesoftinteam@gmail.com with the subject line: "Frontend Developer Test Submission - [Your Name]".

*Submission Deadline:* Please submit your work by September 28nd, 2023.

*Evaluation Criteria:*
- Code quality and organization.

- Implementation of responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Routing and navigation between views.

Good luck! We look forward to reviewing your submission.



<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->
